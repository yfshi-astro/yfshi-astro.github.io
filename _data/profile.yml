    你好 Nihao! I am Yángfān Shī (施杨帆), a final-year Ph.D. student at 
    the <a href="https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University</a>,
    advised by <a href="https://gherczeg.github.io/" target="_blank">Gregory Herczeg</a> and 
    <a href="https://long-feng.github.io/" target="_blank">Feng Long</a>.
    During my Ph.D., I also spent one year at the ESO headquarters in Garching with an <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/activities/fellowships-and-studentships/FeSt-overview/ESOstudentship.html" target="_blank">ESO Studentship</a>, 
    working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/emacias/home" target="_blank">Enrique Macías</a>.
    Prior to my Ph.D., I received a B.S. degree in Physics from Shandong University in 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingdezhen" target="_blank">Jingdezhen (景德镇)</a>, Jiangxi province, 
    a city known as the "Porcelain Capital" in China.
